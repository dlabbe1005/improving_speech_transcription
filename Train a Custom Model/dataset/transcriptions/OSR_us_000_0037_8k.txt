The store walls were lined with colored frocks.
The peace league met to discuss their plans.
The rise to fame of a person takes luck.
Paper is scarce, so write with much care.
The quick fox jumped on the sleeping cat.
The nozzle of the fire hose was bright brass.
Screw the round cap on as tight as needed.
Time brings us many changes.
The purple tie was ten years old.
Men think and plan and sometimes act.
