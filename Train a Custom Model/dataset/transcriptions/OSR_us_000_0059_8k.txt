The dark pot hung in the front closet.
Carry the pail to the wall and spill it there.
The train brought our hero to the big town.
We are sure that one war is enough.
Gray paint stretched for miles around.
The rude laugh filled the empty room.
High seats are best for football fans.
Tea served from the brown jug is tasty.
A dash of pepper spoils beef stew.
A zestful food is the hot-cross bun.
