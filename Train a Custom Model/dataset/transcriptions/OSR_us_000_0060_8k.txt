The horse trotted around the field at a brisk pace.
Find the twin who stole the pearl necklace.
Cut the cord that binds the box tightly.
The red tape bound the smuggled food.
Look in the corner to find the tan shirt.
The cold drizzle will halt the bond drive.
Nine men were hired to dig the ruins.
The junk yard had a mouldy smell.
The flint sputtered and lit a pine torch.
Soak the cloth and drown the sharp odor.
