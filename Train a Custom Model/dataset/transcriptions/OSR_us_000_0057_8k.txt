On the islands the sea breeze is soft and mild.
The play began as soon as we sat down.
This will lead the world to more sound and fury.
Add salt before you fry the egg.
The rush for funds reached its peak Tuesday.
The birch looked stark white and lonesome.
The box is held by a bright red snapper.
To make pure ice, you freeze water.
The first worm gets snapped early.
Jump the fence and hurry up the bank.
