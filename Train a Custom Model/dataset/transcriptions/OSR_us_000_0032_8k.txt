A pencil with black lead writes best.
Coax a young calf to drink from a bucket.
Schools for ladies teach charm and grace.
The lamp shone with a steady green flame.
They took the axe and the saw to the forest.
The ancient coin was quite dull and worn.
The shaky barn fell with a loud crash.
Jazz and swing fans like fast music.
Rake the rubbish up and then burn it.
Slash the gold cloth into fine ribbons.
