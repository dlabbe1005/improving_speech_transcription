Slide the box into that empty space.
The plant grew large and green in the window.
The beam dropped down on the workmen's head.
Pink clouds floated with the breeze.
She danced like a swan, tall and graceful.
The tube was blown and the tire flat and useless.
It is late morning on the old wall clock.
Let's all join as we sing the last chorus.
The last switch cannot be turned off.
The fight will end in just six minutes.
