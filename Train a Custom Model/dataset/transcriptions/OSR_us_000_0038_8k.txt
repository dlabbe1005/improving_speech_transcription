Fill the ink jar with sticky glue.
He smoke a big pipe with strong contents.
We need grain to keep our mules healthy.
Pack the records in a neat thin case.
The crunch of feet in the snow was the only sound.
The copper bowl shone in the sun's rays.
Boards will warp unless kept dry.
The plush chair leaned against the wall.
Glass will clink when struck by metal.
Bathe and relax in the cool green grass.
