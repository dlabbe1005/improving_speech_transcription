Every word and phrase he speaks is true.
He put his last cartridge into the gun and fired.
They took their kids from the public school.
Drive the screw straight into the wood.
Keep the hatch tight and the watch constant.
Sever the twine with a quick snip of the knife.
Paper will dry out when wet.
Slide the catch back and open the desk.
Help the weak to preserve their strength.
A sullen smile gets few friends.
