Next came Xbox 360, and now after 360 comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that's how many seconds of thought they put in the naming it. Can you get the butter, please? However, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now I've had to use Leonard. Then get the other one. Pass the butter. Hang on, I don't feel like you're taking this dilemma seriously. Fine Sheldon, you have my undivided attention. OK, now the PS4 is more angular and sleek looking. No way it's true, but the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating. You wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat. Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included. Included, yes. Not sold separately, although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR 5 RAM while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory. Why? Would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts? See, that's what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ES RAM buffer. Oh. Wait a second, who's they? The Xbox. You're kidding. No, I am not. This ES RAM buffer should totally bridge the 100 Gigabit per second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types. This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision? See, I don't know. What should I do? He's fast, the buyer.\""
