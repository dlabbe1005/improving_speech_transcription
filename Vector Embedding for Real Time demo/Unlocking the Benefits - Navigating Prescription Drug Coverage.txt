Prescription Drug
COVERED SERVICES: Prescription Drugs
The Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for prescription drugs. This includes both 
brand name and generic medications, as well as over-the-counter drugs when prescribed by 
a doctor. Northwind Standard also provides coverage for immunizations and vaccinations.
In order to receive coverage for prescription drugs, members must use one of Northwind 
Health’s preferred pharmacies. Preferred pharmacies offer the lowest copayments, and they 
also provide additional cost savings benefits. To find a preferred pharmacy in your area, you 
can use the Find a Pharmacy tool on the Northwind Health website.
When filling a prescription, you can choose to receive your medications through the mail. 
This option is convenient and can help you save money. You can also request prescription 
refills online or by phone, and you can even use a mobile app to manage your prescriptions.
When using a preferred pharmacy, you may be able to take advantage of discounts on 
generic medications. This can help to reduce your out-of-pocket costs. In addition, your 
pharmacy may offer additional savings on brand-name medications, such as 90-day 
supplies or three-month supplies.
It’s important to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain medications, 
including drugs used for weight loss or fertility treatments, compounded medications, or 
drugs that are not FDA-approved. You should always check with your doctor or pharmacist 
to make sure that your prescription is covered under the Northwind Standard plan. 
You should also be aware that Northwind Standard does not cover over-the-counter 
medications, unless they are prescribed by a doctor. If you need to purchase an over-thecounter medication, you will have to pay for it out of pocket. 
Finally, always look for generic medications whenever possible. Generic medications are 
typically less expensive than brand-name medications, and they are just as effective.
