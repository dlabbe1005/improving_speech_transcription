HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS
Choosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health 
insurance plan. With Northwind Health Plus, you have access to an extensive network of innetwork providers. Working with these providers is an essential part of getting the most 
value out of your plan.
In-Network Providers
When choosing an in-network provider for your health care needs, make sure to check with 
Northwind Health Plus to ensure that the provider is in-network. This is important because 
in-network providers charge lower rates than out-of-network providers. Northwind Health 
Plus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including primary care physicians, 
specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This lets you choose a provider that is most 
convenient for you and your family.
It is important to note that in-network providers may not always be available in every area. 
The Northwind Health Plus website offers a searchable directory of all in-network 
providers in your area. This directory is regularly updated, so you can be sure that you are 
choosing from in-network providers that are available in your area.
